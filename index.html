        <p>Dear Amanda, <br>
            We appreciate your recent application to join us at the science faculty of the
            University of Luck to pursue your PhD next year. I'll address each of your inquiries
            one at a time in the parts that follow.</p>

        <h2>
            Starting dates
        </h2>
        <p>However, it would be more convenient for us if you could begin your studies with us
            at the beginning of a semester. The start dates for each semester are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 19 October 2017</li>
            <li>Second semester: 21 February 2018</li>
            <li>Third semester: 14 June 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If this is okay with you, just let me know the start date you would want.
            On our <a href="http://www.example.com/">website</a>, you can get additional details regarding significant university dates.</p>

        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
        <p>As long as the study topics lie somewhere in the spectrum of science and
            technology, the Awesome Science Faculty has a rather open-minded research
            environment. We'd love to have someone on our team like you because you seem
            like a knowledgeable, devoted researcher. In light of this, the concepts you provided
            that piqued our interest the most are, in order of importance:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Making wine out of water and the advantages of Resveratrol for health</li>
            <li>Measuring the impact of crowd size (effect of 5 x 130 > 3 x 14) on the
                performance of funk bass performers at temperatures above 30°C (86°F).</li>
            <li>Musical score representation with HTML and CSS.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Please offer further details on each of these topics, including how long you anticipate
            the research will take, the number of staff members and other resources needed,
            and any other information you feel is necessary. Thanks.</p>

        <h2>Dance</h2>
        <p>Yes, you're correct. I completed research on exotic tribal dances for my post-doctoral
            work. In response to your query, the following dances are some of my favorites, with
            definitions:</p>

        <p>Chicken dancing in Polynesia
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>A complete town would dance around in a circle like chickens to urge their
                    animals or be "fruitful" in 300 BC, a little-known but incredibly influential
                    dance.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The Brownian shuffle in Iceland
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>Before they discovered how to utilize fire to stay warm, the Icelanders
                    practiced this dance, which required huddling closely together in a circle on
                    the ground and moving their bodies in imperceptibly small, extremely quick
                    movements. One of my fellow pupils once claimed that he believed this dance
                    was the source of contemporary movements like Twerking.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Dancing arctic robot
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>An interesting example of historical misinformation is the idea that a new
                    dance form, being practiced by people in Northern Alaska and Canada, was
                    found by English explorers in the 1960s. This dance form was characterized
                    by "robotic," stilted gestures. However, it was later revealed that they were
                    simply moving in this manner due to their extreme cold.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            Yours sincerely,
        </p>
